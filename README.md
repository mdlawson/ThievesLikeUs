# Thieves Like Us

Something that may someday be a game. Made in C# with XNA by two idiots (charming...) who dont really know either of those.

Current concept is as follows:

The player must control and coordinate, in real time, a bunch of thieves, each with different abilities/equipment, in order to pull off a heist. This will be done with mouse driven orders, and the ability to directly control one thief at a time. The game will feature realistic vision mechanics (i.e. the place that the thieves were trying to break into would be completely hidden at the start, more detail can be uncovered though installation of sound recorders or cameras, use of heat goggles, locating a floor plan, or direct vision from a thief inside)
