# Thieves Like Us

Something that may someday be a game. Made in C# with XNA by two idiots who dont really know either of those.

Current concept is as follows:

The player must control and coordinate in real time a bunch of theives, each with different abilities/equipment in order to pull off a heist. this would be done with mouse driven orders, and the ability to directly control one theif at a time. The game would feature realistic vison mechanics (aka the place that the theives were trying to break into would be completely hidden at the start, more detail could be uncovered though installation of sound recorders, cameras, use of heat goggles, locating a floor plan, or direct vision from a thief inside)
